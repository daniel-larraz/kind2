(** Invariants are stored in two hash tables mapping them to their certificate.
One table is for one-state invariants, the other is for two-state invariants.

(** Stores invariants. *)
type t

(** The empty collection of invariants. *)
val empty : unit -> t

(** True if no invariants. *)
val is_empty : t -> bool

(** Number of invariants (one-state, two-state). *)
val len : t -> int * int

(** Bumps invariants.

If second parameter is [true], include two-state invariants. *)
val of_bound : t -> bool -> Numeral.t -> Term.t list

(** Filters some invariants.

Function takes a boolean flag indicating if the invariant is two state. *)
val filter : (bool -> Term.t -> Certificate.t -> bool) -> t -> t

(** Adds a one-state invariant. *)
val add_os : t -> Term.t -> Certificate.t -> unit
(** Adds a two-state invariant. *)
val add_ts : t -> Term.t -> Certificate.t -> unit

(** The one-state invariants. *)
val get_os : t -> Term.TermSet.t
(** The two-state invariants. *)
val get_ts : t -> Term.TermSet.t

(** Checks if a term is a known invariant. *)
val mem : t -> Term.t -> bool

(** Returns [Some cert] if [term] is a known invariant, or [None] otherwise. *)
val find : t -> Term.t -> Certificate.t option

(** **Temporary.** Flattens some invariants into a list. *)
val flatten : t -> (Term.t * Certificate.t) list

(** Merges two collections of invariants (non-destructive). *)
val merge : t -> t -> t

(** Formats some invariants. *)
val fmt : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(* Empty hash table *)

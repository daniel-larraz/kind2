(** [generalize f m] evaluates the term [f] with the model [m] and
    returns a term [g] that is implied by the model [m] and that
    implies the term f with the post-state variables existentially
    quantified. The returned term [g] contains only pre-state
    variables.

    [g |= exists y f\[y\]]

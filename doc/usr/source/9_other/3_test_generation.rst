Test Generation
===============

..

   **Disclaimer:** Test generation is, as of Kind 2 1.0, still a rather experimental
   feature. In particular, it works only for models whose nodes have inputs and outputs 
   of simple type (int, real, bool, and enum), not structured type (record, tuple, or 
   array). There is a lot of room for improvement and the Kind 2 team welcomes
   feedback / bug reports.


Most test generation techniques analyze the syntax of the model they run on to
generate test cases satisfying some coverage criteria. Kind 2 does not follow
this approach but instead generates tests based on the specification, more
precisely the *modes* of the specification.

Kind 2's test generation was developed in a context where the actual
implementation of the components is **outsourced**. That is, a *model* of the
system is written in-house based on some specification. The model is then
verified correct with respect to its specification, using Kind 2 of course,
before the specification is given to external sub-contractors that will
eventually produce some binaries but will **not** give access to their source
code. At this point, there is a need to test these binaries in-house.

In this context, syntactic test generation is arguably not appropriate as it
would be based on the syntax of the *model*\ , not that of the actual source code
of the binaries. There is no reason to believe any connection between the two.
Now, the only thing we know of the binaries is that they are supposed to
verify the specification. For this reason, Kind 2's test generation ignores
the syntax of the input model and instead builds on contracts 
(see :ref:`9_other/2_contract_semantics`), and more precisely on the
notion on *mode*.

Combinations of modes as abstractions
-------------------------------------

Modes specify behaviors specific to a situation in a contract, and can be seen
as abstractions of the states allowed by the assumptions of the contract. Note
that because of the *mode exhaustiveness check*\ , there is always at least one
mode active in any reachable state.

One can explore, starting from the initial states, the mode that can be
activated up to some depth. For example, consider the following ``stopwatch``
system:

.. code-block:: none

   contract stopwatchSpec ( tgl, rst : bool ) returns ( c : int ) ;
   let
     var on: bool = tgl -> (pre on and not tgl) or (not pre on and tgl) ;
     assume not (rst and tgl) ;
     guarantee c >= 0 ;
     mode resetting ( require rst ; ensure c = 0 ; ) ;
     mode running (
       require not rst ; require on ; ensure c = (1 -> pre c + 1) ;
     ) ;
     mode stopped (
       require not rst ; require not on ; ensure c = (0 -> pre c) ;
     ) ;
   tel

   node previous ( x : int ) returns ( y : int ) ;
   let
     y = 0 -> pre x ;
   tel

   node stopwatch ( toggle, reset : bool ) returns ( count : int ) ;
   (*@contract
     import stopwatchSpec ( toggle, reset ) returns ( count ) ;
   *)
   var running : bool ;
   let
     running = (false -> pre running) <> toggle ;
     count = if reset then 0 else
       if running then previous(count) + 1 else previous(count) ;
   tel

It seems that any of the three modes from the contract can be active at any
point, since their activation only depends on the values of the inputs. We can
ask Kind 2 to generate the graph of mode paths up to some depth (5 here):

.. code-block:: none

   kind2 --testgen true --testgen_len 5 stopwatch.lus

This will generate the following graph (and a lot of other files we will
discuss below but omit for now):


.. figure:: ./3_stopwatch_1.png
   :alt: Stopwatch DAG
   :align: center
   
   Stopwatch DAG


The graph confirms our understanding of the specification, each mode can be
activated at any time. Say now we made a mistake on the assumption:

.. code-block:: none

     assume not (rst or tgl) ;

It is now illegal to reset or start the stopwatch. The graph is generated very
quickly as with this assumption the system cannot do anything:


.. figure:: ./3_stopwatch_2.png
   :alt: Stopwatch mistake DAG
   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

   Stopwatch mistake DAG


**N.B.** In this simple system, only one mode could be active at a time. This
is not the case in general. See for example the mode graphs for the `mode logic <https://github.com/kind2-mc/cocospec_tcm_experiments/blob/master/graphs/MODE_LOGIC/dot.pdf>`_
or the `full model <https://github.com/kind2-mc/cocospec_tcm_experiments/blob/master/graphs/Mode_plus_Longitudinal/dot.pdf>`_
of the Transport Class Model (TCM) case study.

Generating test cases
---------------------

Since Kind 2 can explore the traces of combinations of modes that can be
activated from the initial states, generating test cases is simple. Each test
case is simply a trace of inputs, or *witness*\ , triggering a different path of
mode combinations in the DAG discussed above.

Each witness is logged in CSV file. A glue XML file lists all the test cases
and provides additional information such as the trace of mode combinations they
triggered in the model.

..

   But aren't the witnesses still based on how the model is written?


Yes they are. There is no way to completely abstract the model/prototype away,
nor is it desirable. Generating test cases solely on the specification is not
realistic unless the specification is extremely strong and precise, which it
very rarely is. (Also, if it was, it would arguably be easier to produce
the object code as a refinement of the specification using the B-method for
instance.)

Oracle generation
-----------------

The point of generating these test cases is to eventually run them on an
executable version of the model to check whether it crashes and respects the
specification.

For convenience, Kind 2 automatically generates an executable *oracle* along
with the test cases. It takes the form of a Rust project in the ``oracle``
subdirectory of the Kind 2 output directory. The best way to learn about how
this oracle behaves is to generate and read its documentation by running
``cargo doc`` in said subdirectory and opening ``target/doc/<system>/index.html``.

The idea is that this oracle will read comma-separated values on its standard
input. These values correspond to the inputs fed to the System Under Test
(SUT), followed by the values *returned by the SUT*. The oracle prints back
the truth values of the guarantees / modes of the original contract as
comma-separated values. (How the outputs are organized depends on your system
and is currently not standardized. Refer to the oracle's documentation.)

Keeping in mind a test case is a sequence of input values each corresponding to
a *step* or *cycle* for the SUT, the workflow is


* read inputs ``ins`` for current step from the test case file
* feed it to the SUT, obtaining some outputs ``outs``
* write ``ins`` and ``outs`` as comma-separated values on the oracle's standard
  input
* read the truth values for the original contract on the oracle's standard
  output

**Note:** In general, the values for the contract depend on previous values
of the SUT's inputs / outputs. In the workflow described above, the oracle
*keeps running between each step* so that it can remember the information it
needs from the previous steps to produce the next guarantee/mode truth values.

An example of a Test Execution Engine
-------------------------------------

A Test Execution Engine (TEE) compatible with Kind 2's test cases and oracles
is available here:

..

   `https://github.com/kind2-mc/teas <https://github.com/kind2-mc/teas>`_


``Teas`` is written in Python, and is able to compare a binary with Kind 2's
test cases using the oracle described above. 

..

   **Disclaimer:** Like Kind 2's test generation feature, ``Teas`` is in an 
   experimental and unstable state.

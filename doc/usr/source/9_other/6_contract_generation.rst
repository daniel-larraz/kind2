Contract Generation
===================

..

   **Disclaimer:** This feature is very experimental. In particular, the modes 
   (if any) of the contracts generated might not be exhaustive. In this case,
   Kind 2 will reject the contract during the mode exhaustiveness check.


Contract generation is intended, at least for now, as a helper for users to
getting started with Kind 2's contract language. Contract generation is
activated by the flag ``--contract_gen``.

Internally, this feature is implemented by running invariant generation on the
input system up to some depth, specified by flag ``--contract_gen_depth``. Doing
so will discover equivalence and implication invariants over the system. The
ones that talk only about the input / outputs of the systems are used to create
the contract dumped in a Lustre file in the output directory.
Note that the restriction to just input and output variables causes many of the 
generated invariants to be discarded currently.

Invariant Printing
------------------

This treatment minimizes the invariants used in the proof of the valid properties,
and shows them in the output without logging them on disk.
Unlike :ref:`9_other/7_invariant_logging`,
this post-analysis does not try to express the invariants as a contract but
in terms of streams used in original model.
Thus, it is more likely to succeed 
(see :ref:`Failures<Invariant Logging Failures>` section in :ref:`9_other/7_invariant_logging`).

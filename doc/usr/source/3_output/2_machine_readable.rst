JSON / XML Output
=================

Kind 2 can output its results in two structured formats:
:ref:`JSON<JSON format>` and :ref:`XML<XML format>`.
They facilite the processing of Kind 2's results by external tools.
The next sections describe each of these output formats in detail.

.. _JSON format:

JSON format
-----------

.. _schemas/kind2-output.json: https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/blob/develop/schemas/kind2-output.json

The JSON output is activated by running Kind 2 with the ``-json`` option.
Its syntax is fully specified by the JSON schema available in the
`schemas/kind2-output.json`_ file.

The root element of a JSON output document is either a :ref:`Log Object` if Kind 2
terminates early with an error, or an array of :ref:`Results Objects`
if Kind 2 succeeds generating some result.
Every :ref:`Results Object<Results Objects>` (including :ref:`Log Object`)
is identified and distinguished from other :ref:`Results<Results Objects>`
objects by a property of type string called ``objectType``.

In a successful execution, a :ref:`Kind2 Options Object` specifies the options
used by the tool, and any :ref:`Log<Log Object>` message is added to the array
as it is written. When Kind 2 is run as an
:ref:`interpreter<9_other/8_interpreter>`, the array includes one
:ref:`Execution Object` that contains a description of the computed values
for the output and state variables.
Otherwise, Kind 2 works as a model checker and performs
a series of analyses. The beginning of a main analysis is indicated by an
:ref:`AnalysisStart Object`, and its end by an :ref:`AnalysisStop Object`.
Within these delimiters, a :ref:`Property Object` describes the result
for a particular property of the input model under the parameters of the analysis.
When the verbose mode is enabled,
statistics and progress info of the analysis is also recorded along
through :ref:`Stat<Stat Object>` and :ref:`Progress<Progress Object>` objects.

Similarly to main analyses, when a post-analysis is enabled, the beginning of the post-analysis
is indicated by an :ref:`PostAnalysisStart Object`, and its end by an :ref:`PostAnalysisEnd Object`.
